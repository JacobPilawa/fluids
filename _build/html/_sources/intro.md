## Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics

These course notes were put together by Jacob Pilawa for graduate Astronomy 207: Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics in the Spring of 2022. The course was taught my Chung-Pei Ma at UC Berkeley. 

The main references in the class are:

* Thorne and Blandford: Modern Classical Physics (Princeton University Press 2017). A pre-published version (January 2013) is available [here](http://www.pmaweb.caltech.edu/Courses/ph136/yr2012/1200.1.K-withContents.pdf).
